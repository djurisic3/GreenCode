# GreenCode - Visual Studio Code Extension

GreenCode is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that enhances your coding efficiency and promotes eco-friendly programming practices. It provides real-time insights into your code, highlighting opportunities for optimization and helping you write cleaner, more efficient code. Embrace cleaner coding practices that not only boost performance but also contribute to a greener planet.

## Features

- **Efficient Code Analysis**: Scans SQL queries and other code sections for optimization opportunities.
- **Severity Indicators**: Highlights code with potential issues using color-coded severity levels.
  - **High Severity (Red)**: Immediate replacement opportunities without functional compromise.
  - **Medium Severity (Yellow)**: Suggested optimizations that might require careful consideration.
- **One-Time Information Messages**: Displays the number of high and medium severity issues upon activation, and also upon deactivation and reactivation.
- **SQL File Support**: When working with SQL files, prompts for login data for database-specific analysis.

## Version 0.1.2 - AI Integration and Setup

### AI-Driven Code Optimization

GreenCode v0.1.2 introduces an advanced AI-driven feature for enhanced analysis and optimization of SQL queries. Leveraging the latest in artificial intelligence, GreenCode now offers deeper and more nuanced suggestions to improve your SQL queries, aligning them with green coding practices.

### Setting Up Your Environment for AI Features

To utilize the AI-powered features, you need to provide your own OpenAI API key. This ensures the security and effective operation of the AI integration. Follow these steps to set up:

1. **Obtain an API Key**: Register at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and obtain an API key.

2. **Configure an Environment Variable**:
   - **Windows**:
     1. Search for "Edit the system environment variables" and open it.
     2. Click "Environment Variables".
     3. Under "System variables", click "New...".
     4. Enter `OPENAI_API_KEY` as the variable name and your OpenAI API key as the value.
     5. Restart your system or log out and in for the changes to take effect.
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     1. Open your terminal.
     2. Edit your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) and add: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'`.
     3. Save the file and apply changes with `source ~/.bashrc` (or the respective file for your shell).

3. **Restart Visual Studio Code** to recognize the new environment variable.

### Cautionary Note on AI Suggestions

While the AI-driven suggestions can significantly enhance code optimization, they should be used with caution:

- **Not All Suggestions Are Directly Applicable**: The AI model provides suggestions based on general best practices and patterns. However, not all recommendations may be directly applicable to your specific code context or database schema.
- **Manual Review is Crucial**: Always review and test the AI's suggestions before implementing them in your code. Ensure they align with your project's requirements and do not introduce any unintended side effects.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use the AI suggestions as a starting point for further refinement and optimization tailored to your specific use case.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage the AI integration in GreenCode to improve your SQL queries while maintaining code integrity and performance.

## Version 0.1.1 - New Features and Improvements

### Enhanced Detection of Cartesian Products

GreenCode v0.1.1 introduces advanced capabilities to recursively search for Cartesian products within SQL queries. This improvement enables a more thorough and in-depth analysis of complex SQL statements, ensuring that even nested queries are scrutinized for potential optimizations.

### Improved Identification of Inefficient Patterns

The extension now features enhanced detection of inefficient patterns, such as `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` operators. The analysis includes a broader range of operators between values, providing a more comprehensive assessment of potential performance issues.

### Updated Message Bar for Document Changes

With the new version, the message bar dynamically updates the count of high and medium severity issues whenever there is a change in the active document. This feature ensures that developers are always informed of the current state of their code, making it easier to track and address issues as they edit.

### Interactive Severity Navigation

GreenCode offers an enhanced interactive experience with its severity navigation feature, significantly improving the way developers interact with the identified issues in their code.

#### Status Bar Integration

- The extension displays the count of high and medium severity issues separately in the status bar.
- Each count is interactive and clickable, allowing developers to swiftly navigate through the issues of the respective severity.

#### Looped Navigation

- Once you reach the end of the list of issues in a specific severity, the navigation loops back to the first issue.
- This ensures a continuous and seamless review cycle, enabling developers to address all issues without manual resetting.

#### Dynamic Issue Count

- As you navigate through and address these issues, GreenCode dynamically updates the count of high and medium severity spots.
- This provides real-time feedback on your progress towards optimizing your code, making the process more efficient and effective.


### Version 0.1.0 - New Features

#### Interactive Severity Navigation

GreenCode now offers an enhanced interactive experience with its severity navigation feature. This feature significantly improves the way developers interact with the identified issues in their code.

##### Status Bar Integration

- The extension displays the count of high and medium severity issues separately in the status bar.
- Each count is interactive and clickable, allowing developers to swiftly navigate through the issues of the respective severity.

##### Looped Navigation

- Once you reach the end of the list of issues in a specific severity, the navigation loops back to the first issue.
- This ensures a continuous and seamless review cycle, enabling developers to address all issues without manual resetting.

##### Dynamic Issue Count

- As you navigate through and address these issues, GreenCode dynamically updates the count of high and medium severity spots.
- This provides real-time feedback on your progress towards optimizing your code, making the process more efficient and effective.

These enhancements are designed to streamline the optimization process, making it more efficient and user-friendly. By focusing on high-impact changes first and then addressing medium severity issues, developers can systematically improve their codeâ€™s performance and contribute to more sustainable software development practices.


## Extension Commands

GreenCode introduces several commands with convenient keybindings:

- `greencode.markDirtyCode`: Activates the extension. Keybinding: `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + F`
- `greencode.deactivateMarkDirtyCode`: Deactivates the extension. Keybinding: `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + D`
